## 🏗️ Architecture Evolution

### **Before: Sequential API Approach**
```
📞 Call → 🎙️ Speech-to-Text → 🤖 GPT Processing → 🔊 Text-to-Speech → 📞 Response
Latency: ~3 seconds per interaction
```

### **After: Realtime API Integration**
```
📞 Call → 🔗 WebSocket Connection → 🤖 OpenAI Realtime API → 📞 Real-time Response
Latency: ~500ms per interaction (80% reduction)
```

### **Current: Hybrid Approach**
```
📞 Call → 🔍 Account Detection → {
  💰 Paid Account: → 🔗 Realtime API (WebSocket)
  🆓 Trial Account: → 🎙️ Traditional Processing
}
```
